# Bedrock-code
- This project demonstrates the integration of AWS Lambda, AWS API Gateway, and Python to create a scalable serverless architecture. The project allows you to execute Python functions via RESTful APIs hosted on AWS.

## Features
 - Python: The main language for the serverless functions.
 - AWS Lambda: Serverless compute for running the Python code in response to HTTP requests.
 - AWS API Gateway: Provides REST API endpoints to trigger the Lambda functions.
 - AWS Bedrock: Platform for managing and deploying machine learning models (if applicable to this project).

## Architecture
- AWS Lambda: Each function represents a specific feature or logic, and is triggered through an API call.
- API Gateway: Acts as a front door, receiving HTTP requests and routing them to the correct Lambda function.

## Prerequisites
- Before setting up, ensure you have:
- An AWS account.
- AWS CLI configured with the necessary IAM permissions.
- Python 3.x installed locally.
